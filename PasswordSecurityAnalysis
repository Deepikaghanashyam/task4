Password Security & Authentication Analysis
📌 Task Overview
This task focuses on understanding password security mechanisms, different types of password attacks, and methods to protect authentication systems.

Tools Used:
Hashcat
John the Ripper
Online Hash Identifiers
1. What is Hashing?
Hashing is the process of converting plain text into a fixed-length string using a mathematical algorithm.
It is a one-way process, meaning hashed values cannot be converted back to original text.

Common Hashing Algorithms:
MD5
SHA-1
SHA-256
bcrypt
Argon2
Example:

Plain Text: password123
SHA-256 Hash: ef92b778bafe771e89245b89ecbc1d17d…

2. Difference Between Hashing and Encryption
Feature	Hashing	Encryption
Reversible	No	Yes
Purpose	Data Integrity	Data Confidentiality
Keys Required	No	Yes
Example	Password Storage	Secure Communication
3. Types of Password Attacks
a) Brute Force Attack
Trying all possible combinations until the correct password is found.

b) Dictionary Attack
Using a list of common passwords to crack accounts.

c) Rainbow Table Attack
Using precomputed hash tables to reverse weak hashes.

d) Credential Stuffing
Using leaked passwords from other websites.

4. Cracking Weak Password Hashes
Example Hash (MD5):
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

Using John the Ripper:

john –format=raw-md5 hashes.txt

Using Hashcat:

hashcat -m 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt

Weak passwords like:

123456
password
admin
are cracked very easily.
5. Why Weak Passwords Fail
Weak passwords are vulnerable because they:

Are short
Use common words
Lack special characters
Are reused across platforms
6. What is MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)?
MFA requires more than one authentication method:

Password
OTP
Fingerprint
Face Recognition
Importance of MFA:
Even if password is stolen, attacker cannot login without second factor.

7. Characteristics of Strong Passwords
A strong password should:

Be at least 12-16 characters
Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
Avoid dictionary words
Not be reused
Be unique for every account
Example:

Weak: password123
Strong: @7Tg#9Lp$2Zx!Qm

8. Security Recommendations
Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2
Implement MFA
Enforce password policies
Use account lockout after failed attempts
Educate users about phishing
Store salted hashes instead of plain hashes
Final Outcome
Through this task I learned:

How passwords are stored securely
Difference between hashing and encryption
How attackers crack weak passwords
Importance of MFA
Best practices for authentication security
